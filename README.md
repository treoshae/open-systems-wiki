# open-systems-wiki
This repository serves as a central hub for the Open Systems project documentation. It provides overviews, system-specific explanations, and architectural diagrams for all systems involved. Feedback and contributions are welcome. As Open Systems evolves, it will eventually become self-sustaining, migrating from GitHub.
